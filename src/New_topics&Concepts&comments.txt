We should store environment variables in our root of the project, where we have
our readme and package.json files
         |
         |
in this project, we are storing that in a file called .env
         |
         |
Never ever push the .env file on github, so include the .env file in .gitignore
so it does not get pushed on github
         |
         |
since we are using vite we will have to use Vite_Name in .env files and
import.meta.env.Vite_Name
to access it in other files

// we created a database, which is blog-base and in that we created a clooection
 of articles.
 //Now an article has basic properties like, title, content, article_image,
 userId etc, we are calling these properties as attributes in appwrite (https://cloud.appwrite.io)
         |
         |
we created appwrite's endpoint url, project id, bucket or storage id, database
id, collection id and saved them in (.env)
         |
         |
we created a Config.js file which has an object named Config, and it has all the
environment variables stored in a simpler and short form, which makes it easy
to access the variables without any errors, as by that we ensured we will be
getting everything in string or our choice of data type (Config.js)
